       SOIL EROSION
       
       
       ## Project description üòÉ :      
                              I have created a informational bot named "SOIL EROSION" using Html and services like QnA maker,Web app bot.It helps the user to finds information about soil erosion.Soil is the most fundamental and basic natural resource for all life to survive. Water and wind erosion are two main agents that degrade soils. Runoff washes away the soil particles from sloping and bare lands while wind blows away loose and detached soil particles from flat and unprotected lands. Geologic erosion is a normal process of weathering that generally occurs at low rates in all soils as part of the natural soil-forming processes.Soil erosion is an important social and economic problem and an essential factor in assessing ecosystem health and function. Soil erosion is one of the  naturally occurring  problems in  soils.  It will  affect all landforms.  Soil erosion may also happen through forces associated with farming activities such as tillage.  Topsoil, which is rich in organic matter, high fertility and soil life, is relocated elsewhere "on-site" where it builds up over time or is carried "off-site" where it fills in drainage channels.   Soil erosion reduces cropland productivity.  Soil erosion contributes to the pollution of adjacent watercourses, wetlands and lakes.
                              
 ###Impacts of erosion:-

1.Reduced ability of the soil to store water and nutrients.

2.Exposure of subsoil, which often has poor physical and chemical properties.

3.Higher rates of runoff, shedding water and nutrients otherwise used for crop growth.

4.Loss of newly planted crops.

5.Deposits of silt in low-lying areas.

##final:

And if you‚Äôre feeling especially inspired by these quotes:

 
1. ‚ÄúEssentially, all life depends upon the soil‚Ä¶ There can be no life without soil and no soil without life; they have evolved together.‚Äù 

 

2. ‚ÄúTo forget how to dig the earth and to tend the soil is to forget ourselves.‚Äù
